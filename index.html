                <h2>We don't play with food</h2>
                <p>When I was a small boy,my father told me never to recommend 
                    a church or a woman to anyone.And I have found it wise never
                     to recommend a restaurant either.Something always goes wrong
                      with the cheese souffle.

             <h2>Eat together</h2>
             <p>There is something profuondly satisfying about sharing a meal.
                Eating together,breaking bread together,is one of the oldest 
                and most fundamentally unifying of human experiences.
